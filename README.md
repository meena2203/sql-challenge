# Unit 9 Homework: Employee Database

## Assignment Overview

As a new data engineer at Pewlett Hackard, I have been assigned to research on employees of the corporation from the 1980s and 1990s. All that remains of the database of employees from that period are six CSV files.

## Methodology
In this assignment, designed the tables to hold data in the CSVs, imported the CSVs into a SQL database, and answered questions about the data. In other words, performed **data modeling**, **data engineering**, and **data analysis**.

### Data Modeling

Inspected the CSVs and sketched out an ERD (Entity Relationship Diagram) of the tables using [http://www.quickdatabasediagrams.com](http://www.quickdatabasediagrams.com). After carefull inspection of CSV files, following relationship was established between the tables :
1. Employee : Title = Multiple : One (multiple employees have same title)
2. Employee : Salaries = Multiple : One (Multiple employees have same salary)
3. Employee : Department_Employee = Multiple : One (multiple employees in one department)
4. Employee : Department_Manager = Multiple : One (multiple manager in one department)
5. Departments : Department_Employee = One : Multiple (one department has multiple employees)
6. Departments : Department_Manager = One : Multiple (one department has multiple managers)

### Data Engineering

* Used the table schema generated by the ERD (specifying data types, primary keys, foreign keys) to create table for each of the six CSV files [EmployeeSQL/SQL_HW_table_schemata.sql]. 

* Imported each CSV file into the corresponding SQL table.

### Data Analysis

Following queries were performed on the  SQL tables [EmployeeSQL/SQL_HW_queries.sql]:

1. List the following details of each employee: employee number, last name, first name, sex, and salary.

2. List first name, last name, and hire date for employees who were hired in 1986.

5. List first name, last name, and sex for employees whose first name is "Hercules" and last names begin with "B."

7. List all employees in the Sales and Development departments, including their employee number, last name, first name, and department name.

8. List the frequency count of employee last names (i.e., how many employees share each last name) in descending order.
