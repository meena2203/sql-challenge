# Unit 9 Homework: Employee Database

## Assignment Overview

As a new data engineer at Pewlett Hackard, I have been assigned to research on employees of the corporation from the 1980s and 1990s. All that remains of the database of employees from that period are six CSV files.

## Methodology
In this assignment, designed the tables to hold data in the CSVs, imported the CSVs into a SQL database, and answered questions about the data. In other words, performed **data modeling**, **data engineering**, and **data analysis**.

### Data Modeling

Inspected the CSVs and sketched out an ERD (Entity Relationship Diagram) of the tables using [http://www.quickdatabasediagrams.com](http://www.quickdatabasediagrams.com). After carefull inspection of CSV files, following relationship was established between the tables :
1. Employee : Title = Multiple : One (multiple employees have same title)
2. Employee : Salaries = Multiple : One (Multiple employees have same salary)
3. Employee : Department_Employee = Multiple : One (multiple employees in one department)
4. Employee : Department_Manager = Multiple : One (multiple manager in one department)
5. Departments : Department_Employee = One : Multiple (one department has multiple employees)
6. Departments : Department_Manager = One : Multiple (one department has multiple managers)

### Data Engineering

* Used the table schema generated by the ERD (specifying data types, primary keys, foreign keys) to create table for each of the six CSV files [EmployeeSQL/SQL_HW_table_schemata.sql]. 

* Imported each CSV file into the corresponding SQL table:

### Data Analysis

Following queries were performed on the  SQL tables [EmployeeSQL/SQL_HW_queries.sql]:

1. List the following details of each employee: employee number, last name, first name, sex, and salary.
